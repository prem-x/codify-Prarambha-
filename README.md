Hackathon Workflow – AI Skin Disease Analysis 
1. Problem Definition 
• Objective: Detect and classify skin diseases from dermoscopic images. 
• Dataset: HAM10000 (from Kaggle). 
• End Goal: Web-based tool for real-time skin disease analysis. 

2. Data Preparation 
• Download Dataset from Kaggle (HAM10000). 
• Data Cleaning & Preprocessing 
o Resize images (e.g., 224x224). 
o Normalize pixel values. 
o Handle class imbalance (oversampling, SMOTE, or weighted loss). 
• Data Split 
o Training set (70%) 
o Validation set (15%) 
o Test set (15%) 

3. Model Development (Python) 
• Model Choice: CNN (e.g., ResNet50, EfficientNet, or custom CNN). 
• Training 
o Use TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch. 
o Apply data augmentation (rotation, flip, zoom). 
• Evaluation Metrics 
o Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score. 
o Confusion matrix for disease-wise performance. 

4. Model Optimization 
• Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size). 
• Use transfer learning for faster convergence. 
• Export best model (saved as .h5 or .pt). 

5. Backend Integration 
• Build Flask or FastAPI backend in Python. 
• Load trained model. 
• Create API endpoint (e.g., /predict) that: 
o Accepts an uploaded image. 
o Preprocesses image. 
o Runs inference through model. 
o Returns predicted skin disease & probability. 

6. Frontend (Web App) 
• Simple HTML/CSS/JS or React frontend. 
• Features: 
o Upload image (drag & drop or file input). 
o Submit button → send to backend API. 
o Display: 
▪ Predicted disease name. 
▪ Confidence score. 
▪ Optionally: Show “possible risks” and “see a dermatologist” note. 

7. Deployment 
• Local Deployment (Flask + React). 
• Cloud Deployment: 
o Use Streamlit / Gradio for fast deployment (ideal in hackathon). 
o Or deploy backend on Heroku / Render / AWS / Azure / GCP. 

8. Final Presentation 
• Workflow Diagram (Dataset → Preprocessing → Model → API → Web App). 
• Demo: Upload sample image → Get prediction in real time. 
• Highlight: 
o Accuracy achieved. 
o Real-world use cases (early skin disease detection, awareness tool).
